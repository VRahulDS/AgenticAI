Title: One Model, Five Superpowers: The Versatility of Variational Auto-Encoders

TL;DR
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are versatile deep learning models with applications in data compression, noise reduction, synthetic data generation, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation. This publication demonstrates these capabilities using the MNIST dataset, providing practical insights for AI/ML practitioners.

Introduction
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that exemplify unsupervised deep learning. They use a probabilistic approach to encode data into a distribution of latent variables, enabling both data compression and the generation of new, similar data instances.
